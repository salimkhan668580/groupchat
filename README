## Rooms

A room is created when two users want to communicate with each other. The room ID is created by sorting the two user IDs and concatenating them with a hyphen (e.g. "user1-user2").

## Messages

A message is sent when a user sends a message to another user. The message is stored in the database and is emitted to all users in the same room. The message object contains the following properties:

* `senderId`: The ID of the sender
* `receiverId`: The ID of the receiver
* `msg`: The message text
* `createdAt`: The timestamp when the message was sent
